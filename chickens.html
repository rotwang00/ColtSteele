          The <b>chicken</b> <i>(Gallus domesticus)</i> is a domesticated
          species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from Southeast
          Asia.

          They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of
          junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green
          junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a
          younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated
          is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually
          immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as
          a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets.

          Traditionally, they were also bred for
          <a href="http://google.com">cockfighting</a>, which is still practiced
          in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for
          eggs, they are layers. Chickens are one of the most common and
          widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
          as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more
          chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural
          references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in
          language and literature.

          Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories
          within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade
          found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated
          from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread
          to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the
          mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having
          come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to
          the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece
          from the 5th century BC.[7][8]
